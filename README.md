This is a <strong>Minecraft 1.8 Java Edition Cheat-Client</strong> which was used and coded for educational purposes only. The main idea was to code something that I'm already familiar with,so I thought why not coding a cheat which teaches me both fundamental und advanced concepts of Java .It's important to mention that the client is <strong>NOT close to finished</strong>.

<strong>I'm aware of the fact that clients like these usually work best when working with packets sent to the server.Even though I did this from time to time,my primary goal was to get familiar with Java and its concepts,not to code a hvh('Hacker vs Hacker') client.</strong>
